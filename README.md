# Weather Drone

This project uses your location (if you allow) to check your local weather and use the data to tune a drone synth and calibrate some video faders.

The synth is powered by Tone.js and the visuals powered by YouTube's iframe API and some JavaScript to fade the videos
Below is a mapping of the weather data to the parts of the piece

#### Cloudiness controls how vibrant the videos are

#### The faster the current wind the faster the filters oscillation

#### The more rain per mm the louder the pink noise becomes
